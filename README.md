# Terraform AWS VPC with EC2, NAT Gateway, and Load Balancer (Multi-AZ)

This Terraform configuration sets up a simple AWS architecture

- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai)
- A NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnet
- An EC2 instance (t2.micro) in the private subnet with a web server (Apache)
- An Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the EC2 instance
- User data to display a welcome page from EC2
- Security groups to control access
- Outputs ALB DNS name to access the app
